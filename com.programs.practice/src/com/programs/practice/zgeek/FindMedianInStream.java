/**
 * Given an input stream of n integers the task is to insert integers to stream and print the median of the new stream formed by each insertion of x to the stream.
 * Example
 * Flow in stream : 5, 15, 1, 3 
 * 5 goes to stream --> median 5 (5)
 * 15 goes to stream --> median 10 (5, 15)
 * 1 goes to stream --> median 5 (5, 15, 1)
 * 3 goes to stream --> median 4 (5, 15, 1, 3)
 * 
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the no of elements of the stream.
 * Then the next N lines contains integer x denoting the no to be inserted to the stream.
 * 
 * Output:
 * For each element added to the stream print the floor of the new median in a new line.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=N<=10^5+7
 * 1<=x<=10^5+7
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 4
 * 5
 * 15
 * 1 
 * 3
 * 
 * Output:
 * 5
 * 10
 * 5
 * 4
