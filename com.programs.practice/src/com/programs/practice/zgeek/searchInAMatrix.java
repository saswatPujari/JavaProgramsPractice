/**
 * Given an n x m matrix, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order, and a number x . The task is to find whether element x is present in the matrix or not.
 * Expected Time Complexity : O(m + n)
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.
 * First line of each test case consist of two space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of element in a row and column respectively.
 * Second line of each test case consists of N*M space separated integers denoting the elements in the matrix in row major order.
 * Third line of each test case contains a single integer x, the element to be searched.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Corresponding to each test case, print in a new line, 1 if the element x is present in the matrix, otherwise simply print 0.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=T<=200
 * 1<=N,M<=30
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 2
 * 3 3
 * 3 30 38 44 52 54 57 60 69
 * 62
 * 1 6
 * 18 21 27 38 55 67
 * 55
 * Output:
 * 0
 * 1
