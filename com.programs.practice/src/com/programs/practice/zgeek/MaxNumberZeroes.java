/**
 * Given an array of n values. Print a number which had maximum number of zeroes. 
 * If their are no zeroes then print -1.
 * 
 * Note: If there are multiple numbers with same (max) number of zeroes then 
 * print the Maximum number among them.
 * 
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of an integer n. The next line consists of n spaced integers.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Print the number with maximum number of zeroes.
 * 
 * Constraints: 
 * 1<=T<=100
 * 1<=N<=1000
 * 1<=A[i]<=100000
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 1
 * 5
 * 10 20 3000 9999 200
