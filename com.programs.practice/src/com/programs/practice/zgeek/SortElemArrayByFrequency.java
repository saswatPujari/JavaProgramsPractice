/**
 * Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. 
 * For example, if the input array is {2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 12, 2, 3, 3, 3, 12}, 
 * then modify the array to {3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5}. 
 * If frequencies of two elements are same, print them in increasing order.
 * 
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
 * The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains 
 * a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated 
 * integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Print each sorted array in a seperate line. For each array its numbers should be seperated by space.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 ≤ T ≤ 70
 * 30 ≤ N ≤ 130
 * 1 ≤ A [ i ] ≤ 60 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 1
 * 5
 * 5 5 4 6 4
 * 
 * Output:
 * 4 4 5 5 6
